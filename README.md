# FamilyPortrait
A virtual family e-greating


This is what I want:
1 home page to land on, he must “find waldo” and click in a specific spot.
2nd page is a family photo and a drop down menu of our names. He selects one, eg: Maia
Maia’s page is my greeting to him + a photo of me. same for my parents
Once he’s seen all three (some trigger tbd), he goes to the end where there is an other family photo.
